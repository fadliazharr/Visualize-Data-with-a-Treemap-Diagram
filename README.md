# Video Game Sales Treemap

This project visualizes video game sales data using a treemap chart. Each tile represents a specific video game, and the size corresponds to the number of units sold. The tiles are grouped and color-coded by category (console platform).

## What It Does

- Displays a hierarchical treemap of video game sales.
- Allows users to hover over each tile to view details such as game name, category, and sales value.
- Includes a legend showing the category color mapping.

## How It Was Made

The project uses D3.js to parse hierarchical JSON data and render a responsive SVG-based treemap. A tooltip provides interactivity, and the legend is generated dynamically based on the dataset categories.

## Tools Used

- D3.js (v6+)
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- FreeCodeCamp Test Suite for validation
